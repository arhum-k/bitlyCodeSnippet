*Code snippet for Bitly's Frontend Engineer Internship application.*

# Snippet from Choco.Quest

Choco.Quest is an AI tool that allows students to have the voice of their favorite celebrities/characters (Kobe Bryant, Batman, etc) guide them through their worksheets and offer assistance when needed. 

On the platform, teachers create worksheets, share them to their students via URL, and students can begin their worksheet. See more about the project [here](https://arhumk.notion.site/Arhum-s-Portfolio-860752b0e7ce4fbeaf773457d4198486?p=318b697aabdb40649acb21b832a6d12a&pm=c)! 

## Frontend technology used:
NextJS, Typescript, TailwindCSS, React Components & State Management

## About the Code Snippet
My code snippet is from the dashboard where teachers can see all the students that completed their worksheet, and each one of their conversations with the AI character.
This code is useful for teachers so that they can see how their students are interacting wth the AI and what their areas of weakness/strength are.

This code uses React's useEffect and useState, conditional rendering, fetch requests to backend to collect & display data, and more.

### Notes
In the code, you wll also find some commented out code -- this code provides an analysis of the student's performance provided by ChatGPT 3.5. It is commented out because our prompt that we provide to ChatGPT on the backend is not up to standards, so some of the responses that we receive from ChatGPT aren't sufficient.
